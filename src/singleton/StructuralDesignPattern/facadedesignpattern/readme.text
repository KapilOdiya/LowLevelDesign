Code Explanation

    HomeTheaterFacade:
    Acts as the single entry point that encapsulates the operations of the home theater subsystem. It provides two main methods:
        watchMovie(String movie): Prepares and starts the movie experience.
        endMovie(): Shuts down the movie experience by reversing the setup.

    Subsystem Classes:
    Each subsystem class (e.g., Amplifier, DVDPlayer, Projector, TheaterLights, Screen) is responsible for its specific functionality. They are orchestrated by the facade to create a seamless experience for the client.

    HomeTheaterTestDrive:
    This client class demonstrates the simplicity achieved by using the Facade. The client code interacts only with the HomeTheaterFacade, without needing to manage individual subsystem components directly.
    
    
    Conclusion

The Facade Pattern effectively hides the complexity of multiple subsystems, offering a simplified interface to the client. By using a short and clear facade overview in Part 2, we highlight how easily complex systems like a home theater can be managed. This two-part guide—with detailed theory, UML/PlantUML diagrams, SOLID analysis, and a practical Java implementation—serves as an excellent educational resource for understanding and applying the Facade Pattern in real-world software development.
