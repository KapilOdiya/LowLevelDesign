Implementation Concepts and Best Practices

    Composition over Inheritance:
    By wrapping objects in decorators, we extend functionality dynamically without resorting to an explosion of subclasses.

    Transparency:
    Every decorator implements the same Coffee interface. Clients interact with the object uniformly regardless of how many decorators are applied.

    Modularity and Flexibility:
    The design adheres to SOLID principles by keeping each class focused on a single responsibility. New decorators (like adding whipped cream or caramel) can be added without modifying existing code.

    Documentation and Readability:
    Each class and method is well-documented to ensure clarity. This approach aids in maintenance and understanding, especially in larger software projects.
    
The Coffee interface that declares the common methods.
SimpleCoffee as the concrete component implementing the interface.
CoffeeDecorator as an abstract decorator holding a reference to a Coffee object.
MilkDecorator and SugarDecorator as concrete decorators extending the abstract decorator.
CoffeeShop as the client that demonstrates the pattern.
