The Composite Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to treat individual objects (leaves) and compositions of objects (composites) uniformly. This pattern is especially useful for representing part-whole hierarchies, where clients can interact with single objects and groups of objects through a common interface.

Key Benefits

    Uniformity: Clients can treat simple and complex elements the same way.
    Flexibility: New types of components can be added without changing the client code.
    Ease of Use: Facilitates operations that can be performed recursively over the entire structure.

Components of the Composite Pattern

    Component (Abstract Interface or Class):
    Declares the common interface for both simple and composite objects. It often defines operations like operation(), which must be implemented by both leaves and composites.

    Leaf (Simple Element):
    Represents end objects in the composition that do not have children. For example, in a file system, a file is a leaf.

    Composite (Complex Element):
    Defines behavior for components having children. It stores child components and implements operations such as adding or removing children. In our file system analogy, a directory is a composite that can contain files or other directories.




Code Explanation

    FileSystemComponent: An interface defining the common operation display(String indent) used by both files and directories.
    File (Leaf): Implements the display method to output file-specific details.
    Directory (Composite): Maintains a list of FileSystemComponent objects and implements methods to add, remove, and display its children recursively.
    CompositePatternDemo: Demonstrates building a file system hierarchy where a root directory contains two subdirectories, each with files. Calling display("") on the root recursively prints the entire structure with proper indentation.
